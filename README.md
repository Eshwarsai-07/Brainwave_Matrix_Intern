Offer letter : Eshwar sai G A.pdf

Task_1 :Build a Python Cyber Security - Phishing Link Scanner 
Description :
This project is a cybersecurity tool designed to detect and analyze phishing links using Python. Phishing is a cyberattack technique where attackers deceive users into clicking malicious links to steal sensitive information. The scanner evaluates URLs based on multiple security parameters, including blacklist checks, domain reputation, and machine learning-based detection.

As of 2025, phishing attacks remain one of the most common cyber threats, affecting millions of users worldwide. Cybersecurity professionals, organizations, and individuals can use this tool to verify the safety of URLs before clicking on them.

Task_2 :PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
Description:
This project is a cybersecurity tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords using Python. Weak passwords are a leading cause of security breaches, making it essential to assess and improve password security. The checker analyzes passwords based on length, complexity, entropy, and exposure in known data breaches.

As of 2025, billions of compromised passwords are available on the dark web, making password security more critical than ever. Cybersecurity professionals, organizations, and individuals can use this tool to create and verify strong passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
